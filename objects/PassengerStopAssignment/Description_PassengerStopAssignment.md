# PassengerStopAssignment

> *→ [Glossary definition](../../guides/Glossary/Glossary.md#passengerstopassignment)*

## 1. Purpose

A **PassengerStopAssignment** links a logical ScheduledStopPoint to a physical Quay within a StopPlace, bridging the gap between timetable planning and physical infrastructure. It determines which platform passengers should use for a given stop, and can be overridden for specific dated journeys to handle operational changes such as platform reassignments.

## 2. Structure Overview

```text
📄 PassengerStopAssignment
  ├─ 📄 @id (1..1)
  ├─ 📄 @version (1..1)
  ├─ 📄 @order (1..1)
  ├─ 🔗 ScheduledStopPointRef/@ref (1..1)
  ├─ 🔗 StopPlaceRef/@ref (0..1)
  ├─ 🔗 QuayRef/@ref (1..1)
  └─ 📄 ValidBetween (0..1)
```

## 3. Key Elements

- **ScheduledStopPointRef**: Mandatory reference to the logical timetable stop being assigned to a physical platform.
- **StopPlaceRef**: Optional explicit reference to the parent StopPlace; can be inferred from the Quay's containment.
- **QuayRef**: Mandatory reference to the physical boarding/alighting position (Quay) within a StopPlace.
- **@order**: Technical sequence number; mandatory but carries no business meaning.

## 4. References

- [ScheduledStopPoint](../ScheduledStopPoint/Table_ScheduledStopPoint.md) – The logical timetable stop being assigned
- [Quay](../Quay/Table_Quay.md) – The physical platform assigned to the stop
- [StopPlace](../StopPlace/Table_StopPlace.md) – The stop location containing the assigned Quay

## 5. Usage Notes

### 5a. Consistency Rules

- The referenced QuayRef must belong to the referenced StopPlaceRef (if provided), or to a StopPlace that logically contains it.
- All references must resolve to objects within the same dataset or an externally referenced frame.

### 5b. Validation Requirements

- **ScheduledStopPointRef and QuayRef are both mandatory** — every assignment must link a logical stop to a physical platform.
- **@id and @version are mandatory** — follow codespace conventions (e.g., `NP:PassengerStopAssignment:1001`).

### 5c. Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> - **Missing assignments**: A ScheduledStopPoint without a PassengerStopAssignment cannot be resolved to a physical platform, breaking journey planning and passenger information.
> - **QuayRef not belonging to StopPlaceRef**: If both are specified, the Quay must be contained within the referenced StopPlace; mismatches create data integrity errors.
