# VehicleScheduleFrame

> *? [Glossary definition](../../guides/Glossary/Glossary.md#vehiclescheduleframe)*

## 1. Purpose

A **VehicleScheduleFrame** contains operational vehicle schedules — the blocks, vehicle services, and duty assignments that define how vehicles are allocated to journeys throughout the operating day.

## 2. Structure Overview

```text
?? @id (1..1)
?? @version (1..1)
?? blocks (0..1)
   +-- ?? TrainBlock (0..n)
?? vehicleServices (0..1)
   +-- ?? VehicleService (0..n)
```

## 3. Contained Elements

- **blocks** – Collection of block definitions grouping journeys assigned to a single vehicle:
  - [TrainBlock](../../objects/TrainBlock/Table_TrainBlock.md) – Block specifically for train vehicle scheduling
- **vehicleServices** – Collection of VehicleService definitions describing a vehicle's complete service for a day

## 4. Frame Relationships

VehicleScheduleFrame depends on **TimetableFrame** for the ServiceJourneys and DatedServiceJourneys that blocks reference. It depends on **ResourceFrame** for Vehicle and VehicleType definitions. VehicleScheduleFrame is typically wrapped in a **CompositeFrame** within a PublicationDelivery.
